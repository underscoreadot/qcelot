# Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 20, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Qcelot** (“the bot”) collects, uses, and protects data.

## 1. Data Collected
Qcelot may collect and store the following data:
- Discord server (guild) IDs
- Channel IDs
- Role IDs
- Command interaction data

Qcelot does not read, store, or log message content beyond what is required to process commands.

## 2. Use of Data
Collected data is used solely to:
- Monitor and report queue status
- Send notifications to configured channels and roles
- Maintain per-server bot configuration

## 3. Data Storage and Retention
Data is stored only for as long as necessary to provide Qcelot’s functionality. Configuration data is removed when the bot is removed from a server or upon request.

## 4. Data Sharing
Qcelot does not sell, share, or transfer collected data to third parties.

## 5. User Rights
Server administrators may request the deletion of stored server-related data by contacting the bot developer.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of Qcelot after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
